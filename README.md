## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run ChessPlusPlus on your local machine:

2. The SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries are already included in the repository. We just need to configure the project settings in Visual Studio:
   - Add the path to the include folders of SDL2 and SDL2_image in the **C/C++ General** settings.
   - Add the path to the lib folders of SDL2 and SDL2_image in the **Linker General** settings.
   - Add the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries in the **Linker Input** settings.
   - These include and library files are located within the cloned repository's respective SDL folders.
3. Build and run the `Main.cpp` file, and you are ready to go!
